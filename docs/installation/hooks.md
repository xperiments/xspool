# Hooks Configuration

xspool supports two integration hooks that allow it to communicate with external systems. Only **one hook can be active at a time**.

## üìå **Available Hooks**

### **1. xtouch Hook**

- This hook allows xspool to integrate directly with **xtouch** for enhanced spool management.
- **Configuration**:
  - Requires entering the **IP Address** of the xtouch device.

<div style={{marginTop:"48px",marginBottom:"48px"}}>
<img src={screenshot1} style={{width:"260px", borderRadius:"25px", marginRight:"16px"}}/>
</div>

### **2. BBLocal Hook**

- This hook connects xspool to a **BBLocal** instance, enabling spool management within a local BambuLab setup.
- **Configuration**:
  - Requires the following values:
    - **IP Address** ‚Äì The local IP of the BambuLab printer or BBLocal server.
    - **Access Code** ‚Äì A unique code required for authentication.
    - **Serial Number** ‚Äì The serial number of your BambuLab printer.

</div>

## üîé **How to Find BBLocal Credentials?**

To correctly configure the **BBLocal Hook**, you need to retrieve the required values from your **BambuLab device or BBLocal server**. You can find this information in BambuLab‚Äôs official documentation:

‚û°Ô∏è **[Enable LAN Mode](https://wiki.bambulab.com/en/knowledge-sharing/enable-lan-mode)**  
‚û°Ô∏è **[Find Printer Serial Number](https://wiki.bambulab.com/en/general/find-sn)**

## ‚ö† **Important Notes**

- Switching between **xtouch Hook** and **BBLocal Hook** will disable the previously active hook.
- Make sure your network allows communication between xspool and the target device.
- If you encounter connection issues, verify that your **IP, Access Code, and Serial Number** are correct.

Once configured, xspool will seamlessly integrate with your selected hook, providing enhanced spool management tailored to your workflow. üöÄ
